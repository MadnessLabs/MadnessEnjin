# <a name="welcome"></a> Welcome

This project is being built with the [Madness Enjin](https://github.com/MadnessLabs/MadnessEnjinCLI), so it helps to understand some basic concepts of the tool.  All of the variables for your application are stored in ```enjin.json``` file.  You also have a ```.env``` files to overwrite variables set in enjin.json or add new values per environment.  Then all the commands accept a ```-e``` flag that you can use to set the environment.  So an example would be I create the following file in the root or run ```enjin env app``` to have it created for you.

### .env-app

```
{
    "mobile": true,
    "local": false,
    "debug": true,
    "enjinPath": "C:/xampp/htdocs/EnjinCLI/",
    "type": "madnessionic",
    "android": {
        "keystorePassword": "YOUR ANDROID KEYSTORE PASSWORD"
    }
}
```

Now you can run ```gulp android -e app``` to run a build on android using the ```.env-app``` file you created.  This is a very powerful concept that could make any variable change per environment.  You could have colors set to signify each environment, pages that are environment exclusive, or it's also a great place to store sensitive information as shown above with the Android keystore password because it shouldn't be synced with the repo.

The other huge part of the Enjin is the [Commands](#commands) that allow you to generate code, automate dumb tasks, and maintain code quality.  This README should serve as a guide on how to use all of these wonderful tools.  Enjoy and if we have helped you out in any way then please [Support us on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/madnesslabs) so we can continue to development on Madness Enjin.

# <a name="dependencies"></a> Dependencies

This sections starts with a reference list of all of the dependencies so that you can understand what each of these peices do.  Then there is step-by-step instructions on how to install the dependencies.

### <a name="instructions"></a> SETUP ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Install NodeJS** by clicking the "Install" button on their <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Home Page</a> and following the instructions
2. **Open Shell** and run the following command  
```npm install -g madnessenjin cordova ionic browser-sync gulp jade typescript typings jadelint sass-lint```


After you Have installed all of the dependencies using the step by step above you can install project using the [installation instructions](#installation). Then you are ready to start hacking with the platform. 

---

# <a name="installation"></a> Installation

Installation is required if you wish to view the application.  This assumes you have installed all of the **[Dependencies](#dependencies)**. Run the command below to install the build dependencies, build the web root from source files, and start a [Browser Sync](http://www.browsersync.io/) session in the default browser, to begin building.

FOR PUBLIC REPOS

```
enjin install [GITHUB_REPO]
```

OR FOR PRIVATE REPOS

```
enjin install [GITHUB_USERNAME]:[GITHUB_PASSWORD]@[GITHUB_REPO]
```

OR OLD FASHIONED WAY

```
git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_REPO].git
Password: [GITHUB_PASSWORD]
cd dexsphere
npm install
``` 

Now watch your console go crazy and wait for it to ask you some questions about your app.  Answer the questions, then it will finish the install and open your new app in the browser, ready to be worked on.

# <a name="getting-started"></a> Start Building

We have tried to make developing applications as easy as possible.  We create a project file for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), but this is by no means exclusive to that program. If you aren't using Sublime Text then skip to the [Other RTE](#other-rte) section.


### <a name="sublime"></a> SUBLIME TEXT  

1. Open Sublime Text project file located in root. ( <PROJECT NAME>.sublime-project )
2. Select "Tools" -> "Build" (Ctrl + B) to start build with GulpJS.
3. Open browser to project and click the Live Reload extension making sure the black dot fills in on the icon.

That's it! Now when you make changes to the files in src/ directory, the browser will reload to show changes auto-magically.

### <a name="other-rte"></a> OTHER EDITOR

Open Shell to project's root and run
 ```
 gulp
 ```
That's it! Now when you make changes to the files in src/ directory, the browser will reload to show changes auto-magically.

# <a name="commands"></a> Commands

Enjin commands allow us to automate the repetitive tasks that come with scaling a project. Here is a list of the commands available in this repo along with a short description of what they do and the list of flags that they accept.  The flags are not required, but they allow you to get somewhere quicker if you know what you want rather than answering a bunch of prompts.

### **gulp**
- -e [ENVIRONMENT] => This is the environment you would like to build for

General command for building and running a live reloading server.

### **gulp android**
- -e [ENVIRONMENT] => This is the environment you would like to build for

Build, package APK and run Android app on emulator or device .

### **gulp deploy**
- -e [ENVIRONMENT] => This is the environment you would like to build for
- -n [NOTE] => The note you would like on the deploy

A wrapper for Ionic Deploy that builds and deploys to selected environment.

### **gulp install**

This command will be run on a brand new project in order to setup your enjin.json and get the project ready to be worked on.

### **gulp ios**
- -e [ENVIRONMENT] => This is the environment you would like to build for

Build and package app so that it may be deployed via xCode.

### **gulp lint**

# <a name="custom-commands"></a> Custom Commands

If you looked at the gulpfile.js you may have noticed that it doesn't include any of these tasks?!? This is because the build tasks are stored globally so that they can be updated and improved.

If you need your own custom tasks for your project just create a folder named "tasks" under the root and create a new .js file for each new task as shown below.

### tasks/example.js
```javascript
module.exports = function(gulp, callback) {
    return gulp.src('file.txt')
        .pipe(gulp.dest('newLocation/folder'));
};
```
And to run I would just use ```gulp example``` because of the filename.  You can also use folders to organize your tasks.  So you could make a folder named "example" and fill it with tasks and run them like this ```gulp example:taskOne``` .
